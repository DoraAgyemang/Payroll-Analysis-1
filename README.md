# Employee Payroll Data Analysis with excel
## Overview
This project is about employee payroll analysis for the month of January which I did. In this project I analized:
- The hours worked by employees
- Employee salary 
- Extra hours worked
- Employee bonuses and the total pay after the bonus for the month
- Minimum employee salary
- Maximum employee salary
- Average employee salary
  ### Employee salary by hours worked
  Every employee has an hour rate they get paid depending on the department they work. So the hour rate is multiplied by the number of hours worked to get the salary for all the weeks.<p>
